# Simple Mart E-commerce Application - Project Summary

## Overview
Simple Mart is a full-stack e-commerce application built with Express.js backend and Flutter frontend, featuring user authentication, product management, shopping cart, and order processing.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Express.js + MongoDB with JWT authentication
- **Frontend**: Flutter with Provider state management
- **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with secure storage

## Project Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Project Setup (COMPLETED)
- Express.js backend initialization
- MongoDB connection setup
- Project structure establishment
- Dependencies installation

### ✅ Phase 2: Database Models (COMPLETED)
- User model with authentication fields
- Product model with inventory management
- Cart model for shopping functionality
- Order model for purchase tracking
- All models with proper validation and relationships

### ✅ Phase 3: REST API Implementation (COMPLETED)
- **Authentication Endpoints**: Register, login, logout, profile management
- **Product Endpoints**: CRUD operations, search, categories
- **Cart Endpoints**: Add, remove, update quantities, clear cart
- **Order Endpoints**: Create, view, track orders
- JWT middleware for route protection
- Error handling and validation
- API testing confirmed working

### ✅ Phase 4: Flutter Frontend Setup (COMPLETED)
- **Dependencies**: provider, dio, shared_preferences, flutter_secure_storage
- **Models**: User, Product, CartItem, Order with JSON serialization
- **API Service**: Dio HTTP client with JWT interceptors, error handling
- **State Management**: 
  - AuthProvider (login, logout, token management)
  - ProductProvider (product catalog, search)
  - CartProvider (cart operations, persistence)
  - OrderProvider (order management, history)
- **App Structure**: MultiProvider setup with Material Design 3
- **Build Verification**: Successfully compiles for web platform
